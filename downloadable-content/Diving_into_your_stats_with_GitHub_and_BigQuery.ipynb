        "Most of the workplaces I have worked at, Google included, have some kind of performance evaluation system, usually yearly or bi-yearly. And without fail every one of these systems likes numbers. Because a lot of my work is done in the open, I have taken to diving into my GitHub usage to try and gain insights to what I am up to when evaluation time comes around. While the number of commits or lines of code you have commited don't translate directly to the impact of the work, they do often help to refresh my memory on where I spent time, the work I have done, and the sort of work I focus on to provide value. \n",
